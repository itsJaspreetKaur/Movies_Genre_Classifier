🎬 Movies Genre Classifier

This project is a **machine learning model** that predicts the genre of a movie based on textual and/or structured input features like **movie descriptions, titles, or metadata**. The goal is to classify movies into genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, etc., using natural language processing (NLP) and classification algorithms.

🚀 Features

* Preprocessing of movie data using NLP techniques
* Feature extraction with TF-IDF or word embeddings
* Multi-class classification using models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest
* Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix
* Clean and interactive Jupyter notebook for easy experimentation

📁 Dataset

The dataset may include:

* Movie titles
* Descriptions or plot summaries
* Genre labels (multi-label or single-label)

> You can use publicly available datasets like [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) or [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK / SpaCy (for NLP)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)
* Jupyter Notebook

🎯 Goal

To demonstrate how machine learning and NLP techniques can be applied to real-world classification tasks like genre prediction, and to build an extendable ML pipeline for text classification problems.
